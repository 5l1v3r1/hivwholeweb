<b>Notes:</b>
<ul>
    <li>The graph shows coverage at every postition in the genome.</li>
    <li>The red line indicates the number of amplified RNA templates estimated from two limiting dilution series. </li>
    <li>The each fragment corresponds to one of the peaks in coverage. 
        Coverage tends to be lower towards the end of the fragments.</li>
    <li>Where fragments overlap, the sum of reads from both fragments is reported</li>
    <li>Some fragments amplify less well than other (F5 in particular). These tend to have low coverage or are sometimes missing completely.</li>
