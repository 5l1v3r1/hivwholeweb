<b>Notes:</b>
<ul>
    <li>The graph shows coverage at every postition in the genome.</li>
    <li>The each fragment corresponds to one of the peaks in coverage.</li>
    <li>In fragment overlaps??? </li>
    <li>Some fragments amplify less good than others (F5 in particular). These tend to have low coverage or are missing completely.</li>
