This page gives access to the data for download. There are three ways to query the data set:
<ol>
 <li><b>Clinical and summary data:</b> Tables containing clinical information (viral load, CD4+ counts), the patient reference sequence for mapping, and the single nucleotide variant frequency tables.</li>
 <li><b>Haplotypes:</b> Extended genetic variants, including minor ones, covering standard or custom genomic regions.</li>
 <li><b>Sequencing reads:</b> The filtered sequencing reads, mapped against the single fragments of the patient-specific reference. Download the genbank (GB) version of the reference to find PCR fragment annotations.</li>
</ol>
