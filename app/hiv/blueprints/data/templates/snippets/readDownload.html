<b>Notes:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Select the patient of interest in the tabs above.</li>
    <li>The words BAM in the table link to the mapped reads for each time points and amplified fragment.</li>
    <li>For each BAM file, the mapping reference is the corresponding fragment of the genbank (GB) patient reference sequences above. For instance, if a certain read has position 100 in amplicon F5 and patient p1, one must open the GB reference file from patient p1, browse the annotations for F5, and add 100 to its position.</li>
    <li>A dash indicates a fragment that we were unable to sequence.</li>
    <li>Some of these files are large!</li>
