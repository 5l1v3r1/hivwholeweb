<b>Phred scores and actual error rates:</b>
<ul>
    <li>PhiX control (provided by Illumina) was spiked in all sequencing run to monitor sequencing errors.</li>
    <li>Reported phred quality correlates well with the actual error rate down to 0.1% (Q30)</li>
    <li>In HIV amplicons, other sources of errors, such as PCR, dominate over sequencing errors (after filtering for >Q30)</li>
</ul>
