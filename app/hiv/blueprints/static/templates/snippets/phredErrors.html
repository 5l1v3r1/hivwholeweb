<b>Assessment of phred quality from the sequencing platform:</b>
A control DNA, PhiX, was spiked in all sequencing run to monitor sequencing errors. The phred quality estimated by the base calling program, CASAVA, correlates well with the actuall error rate around the typical threshold, 30.This gives confidence to the estimate that the sequencing error rate on the cleaned reads is around 0.1%. Notice that other error sources, such as PCR, are usually more relevant.
