<b>Minor variant frequencies in overlaps</b> between the PCR amplicons are an independent control for the minimal frequency that can be called confidently. It was found that this level is strongly correlated with the number of template molecules in the serum sample: the fewer molecules were available, the stronger the scatter in frequency, because one PCR (leading fragment) might amplify more or less templates than the overlapping one (trailing fragment).
